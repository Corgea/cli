   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install maturin
   ```

3. Build and install the package in development mode:
   ```
   maturin develop
   ```

1. Create and activate a conda environment:
   ```
   conda create -n corgea-cli python=3.8
